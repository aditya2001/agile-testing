Incremental means its delivered in small packets of end to end functionality.

### 2. Agile Testing?
Agile testing is integrated with agile software development.It focuses on ensuring quality throughout Agile software development process.

Agile testing is a software testing practice that follows the principles of agile software development. It is an iterative software development methodology where requirements keep changing as per the customer needs.  
Testing is done in parallel to the development of an iterative model. Test team receives frequent code changes from the development team for testing an application.

### 3. Agile Testing Principles?
1. Continuous testing - Ensuring product quality during agile development process where a working product is delivered in every sprint.
2. Code Quality - Regular testing using CICD tools to maintain code quality.
3. Client satisfaction - Taking clients feedback after every release and incorporating new changes.
4. Whole team participation - Developers, business analyst and testers are part of agile process.
5. Quick feedback - Since a working product is delivered, we get a quick feedback from client.

### 4. Sprint in Agile methodology?
In Agile methodology, sprint is a short duration usually 2 weeks where team aims to complete a defined amount of work.

### 5. What are the principles of Agile Software Development?
1. Customer satisfaction is highest priority.
2. Deliver working software frequently.
3. Business people, developers and testers work together.
4. Welcome changing requirements.
5. Continuous testing using CICD tools like Jenkins.

### 6. What approach do you follow when requirements change continuously?
Team should work closely with product owner to understand the scope of the change and impact.
Testing team make sure all test are automated and run them on daily basis to find any regression defects.
