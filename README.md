## Agile Testing

### 1. What is Agile methodology?
Agile is a iterative incremental approach to software development. Iterative means work is delivered frequently rather than all at once.
Incremental means its delivered in small packets of end to end functionality.

### 2. Agile Testing?
Agile testing is integrated with agile software development.It focuses on ensuring quality throughout Agile software development process.

Agile testing is a software testing practice that follows the principles of agile software development. It is an iterative software development methodology where requirements keep changing as per the customer needs.  
Testing is done in parallel to the development of an iterative model. Test team receives frequent code changes from the development team for testing an application. As user stories are completed, code is merged and test frequently on CICD environments.

### 3. Agile Testing Principles?
1. Continuous testing - Ensuring product quality during agile development process where a working product is delivered in every sprint.
2. Code Quality - Regular testing using CICD tools to maintain code quality.
3. Client satisfaction - Taking clients feedback after every release and incorporating new changes.
4. Whole team participation - Developers, business analyst and testers are part of agile process.
5. Quick feedback - Since a working product is delivered, we get a quick feedback from client.

### 4. Sprint in Agile methodology?
In Agile methodology, sprint is a short duration usually 2 weeks where team aims to complete a defined amount of work.

### 5. What are the principles of Agile Software Development?
1. Customer satisfaction is highest priority.
2. Deliver working software frequently.
3. Business people, developers and testers work together.
4. Welcome changing requirements.
5. Continuous testing using CICD tools like Jenkins.

### 6. What approach do you follow when requirements change continuously?
Team should work closely with product owner to understand the scope of the change and impact.
Testing team make sure all test are automated and run them on daily basis to find any regression defects.

### 7. What is burn up and burn down charts?
Burn up and burn down projects are used to keep track of project progress. 

1. Burn up charts represents how much work has been completed in the project.
2. Burn down charts represents how much work is remaining in the project.

### 8. Difference between product backlog and sprint backlog?

1. Product backlog includes all the items and task to be completed so that end product can be developed. The product owner is responsible for managing product backlog.
2. Sprint backlog includes selected items that must be completed for the sprint.

The scrum master organizes the meeting for upcoming sprint called as sprint planning meeting. The list of items that are added to particular sprint is called as Sprint Backlog.

### 9. Test Driven Development?
Test Driven Development is a technique where we first add a test before we write a production code.
Next we run the test and based on the result refactor the code to full the requirement.

### 10. What is Epic, user story and task?
1. User Story is a actual business requirement created by product owner.
2. To accomplish the business requirement, task is created inside user story.
3. Epic is group of related user story.
